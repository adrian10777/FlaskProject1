    My interest in nutrition began in 9th grade after watching a documentary called Food inc where I learned about
    Monsanto and the detrimental effects they are having on our <br> foods. I learned the benefits of eating organic
    foods and my interest in health was sparked up to the point where my whole household became filled with organic
    products. A <br> couple of years later I became heavily involved in exercise and came to the belief from what others
    would tell me at the gym, that eating anything, and everything is fine, and <br> I wanted to just get as big as
    possible and look good on the outside but completely disregard the inside. Over time my friend started taking me to
    church which is where I met <br> Angelica. She changed my life when she showed me a documentary called What The
    Health. After watching that I wanted to change my lifestyle immediately for my health.<br>
    <br>
    Around the same time as I was going to church (The Seventh Day Adventist Church) I learned about their impactful
    health message, and it clicked. I was surprised to learn <br> that the longest living people in the planet are found
    in the Loma Linda blue zone, and they can live up to 10-14 years longer than the average American! Why? because <br>
    Seventh day Adventists are bible believing Christians who follow Gods original diet found in Genesis 1:29 which
    consists of fruits, nuts, seeds, grains, and legumes <br> (vegetables was added later in Genesis 3:18). So, I
    thought to myself God designed this diet 6,000 years ago and even designed it before he made us on the 3rd day
    (Genesis <br> 1:11-12), and it is the only diet in the bible that he called perfect (Genesis 1:31) and Adventists
    are living the longest and have a great quality of life by following it? I told myself count me in!
    <br>
    <br>
    After deciding to go vegan I started to not feel well. I became sick, weak, lost weight, and honestly felt terrible
    overall. But then I met a Doctor in Original Medicine called <br> Dr. Joseph Bruno who helped me bounce back with
    some tweaks and after learning what he taught me I came to the realization that I had no idea what I was doing. Ever
    <br> since then I have been studying nutrition rigorously and I have concluded that there is too much evidence to
    support that the vegan diet is the healthiest diet you can be on. <br> With the knowledge that I have learned
    throughout the years, I did not want anyone making the same mistake that I did and want you to get prepared to
    thrive on a vegan diet!
